## Technical Architecture

### Components

- **Background Service Worker** (`background.js`) - Handles extension lifecycle, API calls, and message passing
- **Content Script** (`content.js`) - Injected into Digikala pages to extract product data and show floating widget
- **Popup Interface** (`popup.html` + `popup.js`) - Extension popup for manual searches and price comparisons
- **Styling** (`content.css`) - CSS for the floating widget with Persian/Farsi support

### Key Permissions
- `activeTab` - Access to current active tab
- `storage` - Local data storage for preferences
- `scripting` - Script injection capabilities
- Host permissions for `digikala.com` and `api.digikala.com`

### Content Script Integration
- Automatically injected on product pages (`https://www.digikala.com/product/*`)
- Extracts product information using multiple CSS selector strategies
- Creates and manages floating price comparison widget
- Handles communication with popup and background scripts

## Development Notes

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Complete UI/UX implementation
- ‚úÖ Product data extraction from Digikala pages
- ‚úÖ Floating widget with animations
- ‚úÖ Popup interface with search functionality
- ‚úÖ Real API integration with Digikala endpoints
- ‚úÖ Price comparison showing same product with different sellers
- ‚úÖ Clickable price cards for easy navigation
- ‚úÖ Proper price formatting (Toman conversion)

### API Integration 
The extension uses real Digikala API endpoints:

1. **Product Details API** - `https://api.digikala.com/v2/product/{id}/` - Get detailed product information and variants
2. **Search API** - `https://api.digikala.com/v1/search/?q={query}` - Search for related products
3. **Autocomplete API** - `https://api.digikala.com/v1/autocomplete/?q={query}` - Get search suggestions

#### Key Functions:
- **`getProductCPC()`** - Shows same product with different sellers using product variants
- **`searchPricesAPI()`** - Searches for related products using search API  
- **`getDigikalaProductDetails()`** - Gets detailed product information

#### How It Works:
- **Same Product, Different Sellers**: Uses `product.variants` from the Product API to show different sellers for the exact same product
- **Related Products**: Uses Search API to show similar/related products when searching manually

### Security Considerations
- Extension permissions are scoped to Digikala domains only
- Uses official Digikala API endpoints only
- Content Security Policy compliant
- Safe product data extraction with error handling
- No sensitive data storage or transmission

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Chromium**: Full support (Manifest V3)
- **Edge**: Compatible with Chromium-based Edge
- **Firefox**: Requires manifest conversion for WebExtensions
- **Safari**: Requires additional adaptation for Safari Web Extensions

## Future Enhancements

- Performance optimizations and caching
- Enhanced seller comparison features
- Product availability notifications
