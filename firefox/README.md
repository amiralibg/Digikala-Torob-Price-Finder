## Technical Architecture

### Components

- **Background Script** (`background.js`) - Handles extension lifecycle, API calls, and message passing (Manifest V2 compatible)
- **Content Script** (`content.js`) - Injected into Digikala pages to extract product data and show floating widget
- **Popup Interface** (`popup.html` + `popup.js`) - Extension popup for manual searches and price comparisons
- **Styling** (`content.css`) - CSS for the floating widget with Persian/Farsi support

### Key Permissions
- `activeTab` - Access to current active tab
- `storage` - Local data storage for preferences
- `tabs` - Tab management and programmatic script injection
- Host permissions for `digikala.com`, `api.digikala.com`, `torob.com`, and `api.torob.com`
- Universal permissions for broad e-commerce site detection

### Content Script Integration
- **Main Content Script**: Automatically injected on Digikala (`https://www.digikala.com/product/*`) and Torob (`https://torob.com/p/*`) pages
- **Universal Detector**: Runs on all pages to detect e-commerce sites and products
- **Torob Width Fix**: Special styling fixes for Torob pages
- **Firefox Compatibility**: Enhanced browser API detection and fallback script injection
- Extracts product information using multiple CSS selector strategies
- Handles communication with popup and background scripts

## Development Notes

### Current Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Complete UI/UX implementation
- ‚úÖ Product data extraction from Digikala pages
- ‚úÖ Floating widget with animations
- ‚úÖ Popup interface with search functionality
- ‚úÖ Real API integration with Digikala endpoints
- ‚úÖ Price comparison showing same product with different sellers
- ‚úÖ Clickable price cards for easy navigation
- ‚úÖ Proper price formatting (Toman conversion)
- ‚úÖ Seller ratings and grade display

### API Integration 
The extension uses real API endpoints from multiple platforms:

**Digikala APIs:**
1. **Product Details API** - `https://api.digikala.com/v2/product/{id}/` - Get detailed product information and variants
2. **Search API** - `https://api.digikala.com/v1/search/?q={query}` - Search for related products
3. **Autocomplete API** - `https://api.digikala.com/v1/autocomplete/?q={query}` - Get search suggestions

**Torob APIs:**
- **Torob API** - `https://api.torob.com/*` - Product and price comparison data

#### Key Functions:
- **`getProductCPC()`** - Shows same product with different sellers using product variants
- **`searchPricesAPI()`** - Searches for related products using search API  
- **`getDigikalaProductDetails()`** - Gets detailed product information

#### How It Works:
- **Same Product, Different Sellers**: Uses `product.variants` from the Product API to show different sellers for the exact same product
- **Related Products**: Uses Search API to show similar/related products when searching manually

### Security Considerations
- Extension permissions are scoped to specific e-commerce domains (Digikala, Torob, etc.)
- Uses only official API endpoints from trusted sources
- Firefox WebExtensions compliant (Manifest V2)
- Safe product data extraction with comprehensive error handling
- No sensitive data storage or transmission
- Enhanced Firefox-specific security measures and API compatibility

## Browser Compatibility

- **Firefox**: ‚úÖ Full support (Manifest V2 WebExtensions)
- **Chrome/Chromium**: ‚ö†Ô∏è See separate Chrome version in `/chrome` directory
- **Edge**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Use Chrome version for Chromium-based Edge
- **Safari**: ‚ùå Requires additional adaptation for Safari Web Extensions

## Firefox-Specific Features

- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Uses Firefox `browser` API with Chrome fallback
- **Programmatic Injection**: Fallback script injection when manifest declaration fails
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **DOM Element Handling**: Fixed DataCloneError issues with message passing
- **Universal Detection**: Works reliably across different Iranian e-commerce sites

## Future Enhancements

- Historical price tracking and charts
- Price drop notifications and alerts
- Wishlist functionality with price monitoring
- Support for other Iranian e-commerce platforms
- Performance optimizations and caching
- Enhanced seller comparison features
- Product availability notifications
